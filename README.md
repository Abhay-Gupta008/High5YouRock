# High 5, You Rock! ðŸ¤˜

Welcome to H5YR, where we celebrate creativity and innovation with Umbraco 10.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start your journey by cloning this repository to your local machine.

2. **Spin Up the Site**: Fire up the site using either IIS Express or Kestrel â€“ choose your adventure.

3. **Create a Local DB**: Craft your own local database. We recommend SQLLite for this magical journey.

4. **Run uSync**: Navigate to the back office and unleash the power of uSync from the Settings section. Watch as everything falls into place.

5. **Refresh Your Vision**: After running uSync, refresh the content node. Behold, a Home node will rise like a phoenix. If it doesn't, log out and reawaken your inner explorer.

## Live Tweets Integration

While crafting your masterpiece locally, the feed dances with test Tweet JSONs. For a taste of real-time excitement, summon your own Twitter API keys and cloak them in secrecy. Dive deeper into the art of user secrets [here](https://skrift.io/issues/tell-me-all-your-secrets/).

**User Secrets**:

```json
{
  "Twitter": {
    "ConsumerKey": "YourConsumerKey",
    "ConsumerSecret": "YourConsumerSecret",
    "AccessToken": "YourAccessToken",
    "AccessTokenSecret": "YourAccessTokenSecret"
  }
}
```
